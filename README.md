# PicGo

Your favorite PicGo image bed and PicGo plugins are still available in Siyuan Notes, wuhu~

## Origin

The latest appeal of this plugin comes from the discussion of group friends.

- Group Friends 1:

  How to automatically change the local picture to the picture bed link

  It suddenly occurred to me that if the pictures are all placed locally, it will take up a lot of space when it grows bigger in the future

- Group Friends 2:

  No, this function can only wait for the plug-in

  I originally suggested it, but the local notes use the picture bed to put pictures, it feels a bit fragmented, so it was rejected

  It would be great if it could support batch upload instead of uploading one by one in the document.

- Group Friends 3:

  Mainly local notes, it does not mean that all resource files are also placed locally

  Doesn’t synchronization also require cloud services?

  There are two main points of using image bed. One depends on the network and cannot be completely local. An image bed itself is not end-to-end encrypted. There may be situations where the notes are still there but the pictures are cracked.

- Group Friends 4:

  When there is no network, you can’t see pictures, so what kind of local notes

  If the file is stored in a fixed directory, upload the entire folder directly, and then replace the file links in all notes in batches

- Group Friends 5:

  The picture bed actually feels that it is only useful for publishing and migration

  It is more reasonable that Siyuan currently uploads to the picture bed, local or local, and only when exporting, previewing and sharing is the network link
